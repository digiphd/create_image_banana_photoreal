# üçå Modified Banana Serverless GPU processing

This repo gives a basic framework for serving Stable Diffusion [Photoreal Model](https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-photoreal-2.0) model in production using simple HTTP servers. It is capable of returning up to 3 images at 512x512 without going over the 16GB hard limit on Banana GPU's

Please note that this model can create Adult content. So be careful what you type. 

# Quickstart

If you want to customize beyond the prebuilt model:

**[Follow the quickstart guide in Banana's documentation to use this repo](https://docs.banana.dev/banana-docs/quickstart).** 

*(choose "GitHub Repository" deployment method)*

### Additional Steps (outside of quickstart guide)

1. Create your own private repo and copy the files from this template repo into it. You'll want a private repo so that your huggingface keys are secure or place it as an ENV variable called "ENV HF_AUTH_TOKEN".
2. Edit the `dockerfile` in your forked repo with `ENV HF_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token`
